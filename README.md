## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
    - A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    - How well those variables describe the bike demands

- What is the dataset that is being used?
    - The dataset being used is taken reference from Fanaee-T, Hadi, and Gama, Joao, "Event labeling combining ensemble detectors and background knowledge", Progress in Artificial Intelligence (2013): pp. 1-15, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, doi:10.1007/s13748-013-0040-3.

## Conclusions
- We observed that temperature plays in important role in the demand for shared bikes.
- When there is rainy weather, we can see a negative correlation which indicated during rainy weather, the demand will be low for shared bikes.
- Winter and summer seasons are best in demand for shared bikes.
